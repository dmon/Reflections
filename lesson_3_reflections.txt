When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When your are going to collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because maybe there is a feature you are working on that you don't want it to be yet in the remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is a copy of a repository made in github
A clone is a copy of a repository made locally in your computer
A branch is another version of your code made in your repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So you know all the changes before merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Everyone would have a version of the project in their computer. It would be harder to merge files, gob back to earlier versions, view differences in files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to add a new feature but you want to have a working master.
