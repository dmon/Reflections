How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    You can easily spot the differences without browsing the entire files.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I'll be able to see all the differences made and be able to debug more easily.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros
    	keep verions for each modification 

    cons
    	if you forget to commit you can end up with too much changes made in the
    	file

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because there might be a file that dependes on another file

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log you can see a history of all commits made
    With git diff you can see differences between a file in two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It makes me more confident because I can go back and forth between older and newer commits

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    use it for all my projects
